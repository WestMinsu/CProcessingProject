# CProcessing
 
## What is it?
* It's a framework that provides simple implementations for many of the common things used in 2D games all within the C programming language.
* Graphics, Audio, Input, Fonts, Colors, Math (Vectors and Matrices), Random
* It is a DLL that can be incorporated into projects across many platforms and accessed from many different programming languages.
* It was patterned after Processing (Java) and P5.js (JavaScript)
 
## What can you do with it?
* It's currently used in GAM100 in Redmond, Malaysia and Singapore as a way for students to very quickly build prototype games and even do their first team game.
* R&D uses it for a whole curriculum series aimed at High School students.
* It could be used in other classes such as AI, Math, and Physics where course projects have students demonstrating cool enemy behaviors or dynamic body collisions and resolutions, but they wouldn't need to write a complete engine or know how to do graphics etc.

## What's next?
* Grab a copy of the [Latest Release](https://github.com/DigiPen-Faculty/CProcessing/releases).
* Read through the [Documentation](https://github.com/DigiPen-Faculty/CProcessing/wiki).
* Have fun building awesome stuff!
